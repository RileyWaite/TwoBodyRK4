# TwoBodyRK4
Runge-Kutta 4th Order ODE Solver for Two-Body Orbital System (with visualization). This software was just a quick implementation of an RK4 algorithm that I found from the [Runge-Kutta methods Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Explicit_Runge.E2.80.93Kutta_methods).
